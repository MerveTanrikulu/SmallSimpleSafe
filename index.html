Small Simple Safe -- SSS

SSS is a simple tool for handling classes and objects. You can 
load Java classes and immediately build objects using public 
constructors. Public methods can then be invoked by a single click. 
The results are displayed in the gray message area and in Java 
Console, which may be kept open.  
<BR>
SSS allows very quick access to public methods in any class.  It has
nothing to do with Java syntax.  You can test a class just by clicking
and without writing test code.

  </TR>
  <TR>
    <td align="left" valign="top">
You see two lists on the Applet picture at the right. One shows
classes and objects, the other shows public members of the
selected class or object.  Four classes (String, DemoMenu, 
Factory, Small) and four objects (MSG, pi, s, frm)
are shown in the picture.
<P>
SSS can be used in two modes:
<OL>
<LI>You may click on the Applet button and SSS runs
immediately as an applet if your browser supports JVM 1.3
<P>
<LI>You may download the jar file and run SSS 
as an application prgram
</OL>
