What is SSS?
    </TD>
    <TD class="reply">

<BR>

    <TD class="faq">
Is it for beginners only?
    </TD>
    <TD class="reply">
SSS would be very useful for a beginner learning java.lang.String or 
java.io.File.  A programmer mastering java.net.URL or java.util.TreeSet 
would also benefit from fast learning.  Experienced programmers will also
find it useful as a fast inspector.

    <TD class="faq">
On which system does it run?
    </TD>
    <TD class="reply">
Being a pure-Java application, it works on all platforms
where JVM (1.3 or higher) is installed.
    </TD>

    <TD class="faq">
Do I need to expand the jar file?
    </TD>
    <TD class="reply">
No, the proper way to run SSS is <BR>
% java -jar sssDemo.jar <BR>
Both Windows and Linux platforms allow you to use "open with"
command and then enter "java -jar" as the command.  This will connect
jar files to the JVM and you can open them just by clicking on them.
(When JVM is installed under Windows, this connection is automatic)

    <TD class="faq">
When I invoke a method "X10" is written in the text 
field. Why? 
    </TD>
    <TD class="reply">
Every object under inspection must have a name. (Names are always
better than addresses.)  So every time a new object will be returned,
the user is asked to supply a name. X10 is the default name for the 
first object.  It will become X11, X12, ... as needed.

The demo is in public domain.

    <TD class="faq">
Why SSS?
    </TD>
    <TD class="reply">
Small:   about 100K, as a JAR file <BR>
Simple:  you can use it with no knowledge of Java language <BR>
Safe:    only public members are accessible <BR>
