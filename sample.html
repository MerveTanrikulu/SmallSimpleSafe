The pictures on this page display SSS 
running as an application.  The top window
has the applet contents and the console
shows history.
<P>
The sample screen at the left shows several classes and objects.
Each object is shown with its actual type, local name, and value.  
All public methods of the selected item are displayed at the right
pane. User actions are shown at the history pane (Console) below.
<P>
Three classes (String, TreeSet, DemoMenu) and several
objects (b, t, s, a) are shown at this time.  
A String instance is selected for display.

    <td>
The sample run makes two String objects, b and t.  
Then class TreeSet is loaded and an instance is made.  
Strings are added into the set. 
An existing member of the set cannot be added again.  
There are 3 members at the end, alphabetically ordered.  
Finally, the set is copied into an Object array a.
<P>
The user may clear or save console text.
It is also possible to reset system output to
regular console.
